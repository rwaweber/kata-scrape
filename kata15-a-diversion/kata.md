# Kata15: A Diversion

Think of binary numbers: sequences of 0’s and 1’s. How many n-digit binary
numbers are there that don’t have two adjacent 1 bits? For example, here are
the three-digit numbers:

**`000 001 010`**` 011` **`100 101`**` 110 111`

Five of the possible eight combinations meet the criteria

What is the number for sequences of length 4, 5, 10, n?

Having worked out the pattern, there’s a second part to the question: can you
prove why the relationship exists?
